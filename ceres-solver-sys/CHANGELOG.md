## [0.3.0] 2024-02-26

### Changed

- **Breaking** The only supported version of ceres-solver is 2.2 now, due to some breaking changes in the C++ API, this removes support of v2.0 and v2.1.

## [0.2.2] 2024-02-26

### Changed

- Require `ceres-solver` version to be between 2.0 and 2.1, 2.2 is known to be incompatible.

## [0.2.1] 2023-02-28

### Changed

- Bump `ceres-solver-src` to `0.2.0`. This replaces `miniglog` with `glog` and makes logging configurable. We don't consider it as a breaking change, but by default you will see no output now when using "source" Cargo feature.
- "source" feature: discover `eigen` using `pkg-config`.

### Removed

- CI and "source" feature: Windows build removed. Probably it doesn't work anymore, help needed to fix it.

## [0.2.0] 2023-02-09

### Added

- Support of a lot of new functions and classes throught C++ API.
- `v2_1` Cargo feature which must be enabled to use the crate with Ceres 2.1.0+.

### Changed

-  **breaking** the wrapper is rewritten from binding C API to C++ API with `cxx`. This change is backward incompatible in many ways.
- Minimum supported Ceres version is 2.0.0.
- Minimum supported Rust version is 1.57.0.

### Fixed

- Building issues with system library.

## [0.1.0] 2023-01-19
